## Background
I've always wanted to see the Milky Way again. 

I was 14 when I saw the Milky Way for the first time, while staying in a small mountain village for whatever reason. 
I remember lying on a concrete floor in the middle of the night. 
I didn’t have a camera at the time, nor the vocabulary to fully describe the stunning view I witnessed.

In the summer of 2022, I decided to visit a high school friend and see the Milky Way again. Bro lived and studied in Isla Vista, California. 
Since the best place to view the Milky Way is definitely in the desert, and given that 38% of California is desert, and 
I wasn’t keen on the idea of dying in a remote location, so Death Valley seemed like a viable option.

With the goal set, it was time to plan.

First thing’s first: how to get myself from Vancouver to California. I could drive, or tolerate a flight. 
I really wanted to drive my Subaru BRZ to California—the thought of cruising through the Californian sunset with synthwave music playing in the stereo gives me thrills (and perhaps some IBS-related concerns, lol). 
But driving through Oregon, where I've heard speed limits are strictly enforced, made me wary.

Since I’d never driven in the States and wasn’t sure how speed limits would be enforced, I opted for the less risky option: tolerating a flight.

Once I figured out the means of travel, the rest of the planning was a breeze.

## Day 1 
#### Vancouver - Los Angeles - Isla Vista 
YVR to LAX: As expected, don't expected anything from the flight. 

I picked up my rented Toyota Tacoma from <span className="font-bold text-emerald-500 dark:text-pink-500">[Enterprise Car Rental](https://www.enterprise.ca/en/car-rental/locations/us.html)</span>
at LAX. The process was very easy: just show them the registration emails and driver's license, and you get the keys. 

Two hours later, I arrived in Isla Vista without getting caught in the infamous LA traffic. 
I met up with my friend, settled in at his place, and took a walk around UCSB's campus. 
Man, what can I say? The Californian sunset really does have its charm.

## Day 2
#### Isla Vista - Los Angeles - Death Valley Junction

We headed to the desert at 3:30 AM because both of us were too excited to sleep. 
Since driving to the desert meant passing through LA, we stopped at Santa Monica Beach and grabbed some McDonald's for breakfast.

We then took a stroll around Santa Monica Beach and the famous pier. 
I had visited this place when I was 16 and had also explored it in Grand Theft Auto V. 
Everything was just as I remembered from both my past visit and the game.

</div>

Five hours later, we arrived at <span className="font-bold text-emerald-500 dark:text-pink-500">[Lake Manly](https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/news/lake-manly.htm)</span>
The Badwater Basin's salt flats are expansive and devoid of any obvious life. Seeing this, I truly understood the meaning of 'Death Valley'.

    I am actually stepping on salt. 
</div>

After wandering on the salt flats for a while, 
we arrived at our place for the night: <span className="font-bold text-emerald-500 dark:text-pink-500">[Amargosa Opera House](https://www.amargosaoperahouse.org/hotel/)</span>, 
a vintage hotel built between 1923 and 1925, originally to accommodate investors of the Pacific Coast Borax Company.

It's essentially in the middle of nowhere, antique, and the plumbing system is fragile according to the manager. Despite that, we appreciated its vibe and character.

## Day 3
#### Death Valley National Park
At 2 AM, with the night clear, it was the time for the Milky Way.

We headed to Furnace Creek, where the Milky Way hung bright and high. 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xya89/picx-images-hosting@master/posts/death-valley-2022/pict220430_0319470000-Edited.1zi5qtsme7.webp" 
    alt="" 
    height="500"
    width="900"
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', marginBottom: '20px' }} />
    The camera was set up on the hood of the car, hence the reflection. 
</div>

Suprisingly, we didn't need much sleep. We took a nap afterward and woke up before daybreak to catch the sunrise at 
<span className="font-bold text-emerald-500 dark:text-pink-500">[Zabriskie Point](https://www.nps.gov/places/zabriskie-point-scenic-viewpoint.htm)</span>. 
Yep, the iconic cover of U2's <span className="italic">The Joshua Tree</span>.

    width="900"
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', marginBottom: '20px' }} />
</div>

We drove from Zabriskie Point to Ridgecrest for the rest of the day, had lunch at Stovepipe Wells, and then gradually continued our way.  
Since we stayed on the road the entire time, there was no risk of getting lost.

## Day 4 
#### Ridgecrest - Isla Vista 

We had a desert sushi for dinner and spent the night at Ridgecrest. The next day, we headed to Isla Vista to drop off bro. 
Once again, we switched from endless sands to endless ocean.

</div>

Enjoyed the Californian sunset for one last time before heading back to L.A.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

</div>

If there's a next time, I hope I can drive my BRZ. 

Well, that's pretty much about my five-day 1500 km roadtrip to Death Valley National Park. And I absolutely love the California sunset.
