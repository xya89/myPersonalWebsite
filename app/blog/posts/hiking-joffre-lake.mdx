## Background 
If you’ve read my previous posts or know me in person, you know I love to hike.

I’ve wanted to visit Joffre since 2021, but I was either unable to secure a reservation or couldn’t fit it into my schedule.

In October 2023, I was lucky enough to reserve a night at Joffre, so my friend Tao and I went hiking.

## Day 1
We arrived late in the afternoon, around 3:30pm. Given that we are pretty experienced hikers, we know our pace and the place. 
However, always make sure you leave yourself enough daylight for the hike; it's not a good idea to hike in the dark.

Like always, a photo at the gate.

Then we started our four-hour hike to the campsite at the third lake.

I was enjoying the hike so much that I didn't really have time to take photos.

Here’s what the First and Second lakes look like in July.

We arrived at the third lake on time, took a little break, and had some Clif Bars.

    Didn't notice my pack is thicker than myself...

Then we set up our tents at the campsite and followed our usual routine: fetching and filtering water, eating dinner, just like every other hikers.

I woke up at midnight, as I don’t usually get a good night's sleep, but I was lucky enough to capture some beautiful pictures of the unpolluted night sky:

## Day 2
We decided to go for a walk after breakfast, just to walk around the campsite to explore.

    This is how I usally sleep in the wild
</div>

I know these little 'walks' usually escalate into hikes, 
so I wasn’t surprised when we ended up a couple of hundred feet above our campsite. 
Yep, we headed for the glacier covering Mt. Matier.

    The campsite is just by the lake.

    Here I am, taking a breather at the intersection near the peak. 
    The glacier is easily accessible from here.

And that’s pretty much it. It was one easy hike with superb scenery.
